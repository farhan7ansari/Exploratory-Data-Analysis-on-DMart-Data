# Exploratory Data Analysis on DMart Data

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a sales dataset from DMart (a retail chain). The goal is to clean, explore, and uncover insights about sales trends, product categories, seasonal behaviors, and other patterns that can inform business decisions.

## ðŸ§© Methodology & Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Read the raw dataset (`DMart.xlsx`) into a DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values  
   - Standardize data types (dates, numeric, categorical)  
   - Remove duplicates or erroneous entries  
   - Feature engineering (e.g., extract month, weekday)  
   - Output: `Cleaned Data.xlsx`
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Univariate analysis (distributions of sales, quantities, etc.)  
   - Bivariate / multivariate relationships  
   - Time series trends (e.g., sales over time, seasonal patterns)  
   - Category-wise analysis (by product category, store, etc.)  
   - Correlation and statistical insights  
4. **Visualization & Insights**: Charts (bar plots, line plots, scatterplots, heatmaps, etc.) and key observations.  
5. **Conclusion & Recommendations**: Summaries of findings and possible business implications.
